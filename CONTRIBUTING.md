## üìã Before You Start

### Prerequisites
- You must be an authorized team member or collaborator
- You have access to the private repository
- You understand this is proprietary business code
- You agree to our contributor agreement (see LICENSE)

### Required Reading
- [LICENSE](LICENSE) - Proprietary software license
- [README.md](README.md) - Project overview and setup
- Repository rules and architecture guidelines (see project documentation)

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### 1. Branch Strategy
- **Main branch**: Protected, requires PR and CI approval
- **Feature branches**: `feature/description` (e.g., `feature/add-watermark-toggle`)
- **Bug fixes**: `fix/description` (e.g., `fix/image-upload-error`)
- **Hotfixes**: `hotfix/description` for critical production issues

### 2. Pull Request Process

#### Before Creating a PR
1. **Create a plan**: Outline your changes in 5-8 steps
2. **Run tests locally**: Ensure all tests pass
3. **Check linting**: Fix any ESLint/TypeScript errors
4. **Update documentation**: If adding features or changing behavior

#### PR Requirements
- **Clear title**: Descriptive of the changes
- **Detailed description**: Include step plan, tradeoffs, and risk notes
- **Link issues**: Reference any related issues
- **Screenshots**: For UI changes
- **Test coverage**: Include tests for new features

#### PR Template
```markdown
## Summary
Brief description of changes

## Step Plan
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. ...

## Tradeoffs
- What was considered but not chosen
- Why this approach was selected

## Risk Notes
- Any potential issues or breaking changes
- Migration steps if needed

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests added/updated
- [ ] Integration tests added/updated
- [ ] E2E tests added/updated
- [ ] Manual testing completed

## Schema/Storage Changes
- Any database schema changes
- Any storage/API changes
```

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Required Test Coverage
All new features must include:

1. **Unit Tests** (Vitest + jsdom)
   - Pure logic functions
   - Adapters and integrations
   - Business logic

2. **Integration Tests** (Vitest)
   - API endpoints
   - Database interactions
   - Third-party service mocks

3. **E2E Tests** (Playwright)
   - Critical user flows
   - At least 2 happy-path scenarios
   - Visual regression snapshots

### Test Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:ci

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e
```

## üèóÔ∏è Code Standards

### Architecture Guidelines
- **Server boundaries**: Keep mutations in `/app/api/*` or Convex functions
- **No client secrets**: All API keys server-side only
- **Type safety**: Use Zod for request/response validation
- **External calls**: Use typed adapters in `/packages/integrations/*`

### Code Quality Gates
All PRs must pass:
- [ ] TypeScript compilation (`npm run typecheck`)
- [ ] ESLint checks (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Unit tests (100% pass rate)
- [ ] Integration tests (100% pass rate)
- [ ] E2E smoke tests
- [ ] Build process (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Static analysis on prompts

### Code Style
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled
- **Formatting**: Prettier configuration
- **Imports**: Absolute paths preferred
- **Comments**: Document complex business logic
- **Error handling**: Use typed error classes

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline

### Automated Checks
Our CI pipeline automatically runs:
1. **Type checking** - TypeScript compilation
2. **Linting** - ESLint rules enforcement
3. **Testing** - Unit, integration, and E2E tests
4. **Build** - Production build verification
5. **Security** - Dependency vulnerability scanning

### Manual Review Required
- **Architecture changes** - Database schema modifications
- **Security changes** - Authentication or authorization updates
- **External integrations** - New third-party service integrations
- **Performance changes** - Significant performance modifications

## üìù Documentation

### Required Documentation
- **API changes**: Update OpenAPI specs if applicable
- **Database changes**: Document schema migrations
- **Configuration**: Update environment variable documentation
- **Deployment**: Note any deployment requirements

### Documentation Standards
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Update README.md for significant changes
- Document breaking changes prominently

## üîí Security Guidelines

### Sensitive Information
- **Never commit**: API keys, secrets, or credentials
- **Use environment variables**: For all configuration
- **Signed URLs only**: For R2 storage access
- **Server-side only**: All AI model calls

### Security Checklist
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info
- [ ] Authentication checks in place

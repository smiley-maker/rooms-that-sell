# RoomsThatSell

Real estate agents need to market properties effectively, but empty rooms fail to capture buyers'
imaginations. Physical staging is expensive ($500â€“$5,000+ per listing), time-consuming, and logistically
complex. Existing digital staging tools are often clunky, slow, inconsistent, or non-compliant with MLS rules.

**Opportunity**: A tool that delivers MLS-compliant, fast, realistic, and cost-effective virtual staging with
features that scale for both solo agents and brokerages.

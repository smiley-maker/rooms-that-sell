# RoomsThatSell

**MLS-compliant virtual staging for real estate agents and brokerages**

Transform empty rooms into beautifully staged spaces with AI-powered virtual staging that's fast, realistic, and built specifically for real estate professionals.

## üè† What is RoomsThatSell?

RoomsThatSell is a professional virtual staging platform that helps real estate agents market properties more effectively. Instead of expensive physical staging ($500‚Äì$5,000+ per listing), our AI-powered tool creates realistic staged photos in minutes.
